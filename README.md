# Supervised-MachineLearning-Challenge
### Predicting Credit Risk
### Background
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.
In this challenge, this data was used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. 
### Consider the models
You will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct! Write down (in markdown cells in your Jupyter Notebook or in a separate document) your prediction, and provide justification for your educated guess.
